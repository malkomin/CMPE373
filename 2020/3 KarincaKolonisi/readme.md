# Homework

Dear students,

For your first homework, you will implement Ant Colony Optimisation from scratch. 
 - You __must write__ a seperate `Ant Class` and `AntColony Class`
 - I suggest you to start with [this version](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/uzay00/CMPE373/blob/master/2020/3%20KarincaKolonisi/KarÄ±ncaKolonisi%20v0.ipynb) of code and improve the code.
 
You should follow my [ant colony notes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/uzay00/CMPE373/blob/master/2020/3%20KarincaKolonisi/ant_uzay.pdf) to fullfill the requirements of the code.
